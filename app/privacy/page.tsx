            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p>At Memora, we believe that privacy is a fundamental right of every user. We are committed to providing a privacy-first experience and ensuring that your data is under your full control. We understand your concerns about privacy, and this policy outlines the core principles of how we handle your personal information.</p>

            <h2>1. Local Data Storage & Data Protection</h2>

            <p>Memora does not store your data on any remote servers. All of your data is stored locally on your device, meaning that you have full control over your information. If you enable iCloud Sync, your data will be synced across your devices via your personal iCloud account. This process is encrypted and adheres to Apple's privacy standards, ensuring your data is kept secure and private.</p>

            <p>We do not use any external cloud services to store your data. This means that you do not need to worry about third parties accessing your sensitive information. We promise that we will not collect any personally identifiable information, and all data storage and management take place directly on your device. You can access, manage, or delete your data at any time.</p>

            <h2>2. Data Portability & Full Control</h2>

            <p>We believe in giving you full control over your data. At any time, you can export all of your stored content within Memora, allowing you to back up or migrate your data. We do not lock you into our platform, and you are free to manage your data as you see fit.</p>

            <p>When using Memora, you have complete visibility into the type of data we collect and how it is used. We will not restrict your access to or use of your data in any way. You have the freedom to back up, migrate, or delete your saved information as you prefer.</p>

            <h2>3. Minimal Data Collection</h2>

            <p>To maximize your privacy, Memora only collects minimal data necessary for enhancing the app's performance and stability. We do not collect any data directly tied to your identity, and we do not track your browsing history, location, or any sensitive personal data.</p>

            <p>The main types of data we collect are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> This helps us understand how Memora's features are used, so we can optimize the user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> We collect crash logs to identify and resolve issues within the app, ensuring better stability. This data is used solely for troubleshooting and does not identify you personally.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>All of this data collection is strictly aimed at improving the performance of Memora, and we follow the best practices for data protection during the entire process.</p>

            <h2>4. Transparency on Third-Party Services</h2>

            <p>Memora will never share your personal data with any third parties unless you explicitly opt to use third-party services. We collaborate with a few third-party providers for analytics and error tracking purposes. These services are solely used to improve Memora's functionality and performance, and we ensure that all third-party services comply with their own privacy policies.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>iCloud Sync:</strong> If you choose to enable iCloud Sync, your data will be synced across your devices via iCloud. The data is encrypted, and Appleâ€™s privacy policy governs the storage and transmission of this data.</li>
                <li><strong>Firebase & Other Analytics Tools:</strong> We use Firebase and other analytics tools to collect anonymous usage data to further optimize the app. All collected data is anonymized and is not personally identifiable.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We ensure that any third-party services we use meet the highest privacy standards, and you have full control over these services. You can choose to disable these features at any time.</p>

            <h2>5. Data Access & Deletion</h2>

            <p>Memora only accesses data that you save within the app. We will never access your personal files or data from other apps unless you explicitly give us permission. You can review, edit, or delete any content you save in Memora at any time.</p>

            <p>Within the app, you have full authority to manage and delete your data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and will never access any of your private data without your consent.</p>

            <h2>6. Policy Updates & Notifications</h2>

            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect improvements to Memora or comply with new regulations. When we update the policy, we will notify you within the app to ensure you are aware of the changes. You can always check the latest version of this Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

            <p>Your continued use of Memora after any changes to this Privacy Policy means that you accept the revised policy. If you do not agree with the changes, you may choose to stop using Memora.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
